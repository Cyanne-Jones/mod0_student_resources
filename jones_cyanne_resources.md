# Resources!

- [This markdown cheat sheet!](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- My wonderful partner. I woke him  up this morning with GitHub questions and he was so happy to talk with me through them to make sure I was more comfortable with what I needed to do. He's so lovely ðŸ¥º
- I love using [Notion](notion.so) to take notes. This has been keeping all of my notes so organized and even *color coded!*
- [Codecademy's](codecademy.com) Intro to JavaScript course I started back in December has been a blast. I love the self paced style of being able to spend as much time with the content as you want to make sure you understand what you're learning before you move on.
